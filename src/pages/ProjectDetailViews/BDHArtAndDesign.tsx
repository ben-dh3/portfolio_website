                about="Art & Design showcase utilising Shopify Integration, exploring graphic design principles - colour theory, layout design and typography. The App is deployed and available via the globe icon below.

I have created the background graphics with GLSL shaders and React Three Fibre. The effect is created with a Fractal Brownian Motion function, and uses a mouse movement event listener to interact with the colours.

Deployed using Netlify, I have integrated Netlify forms to collect customer queries. I have used the Shopify Buy Button to enable sales through my site, and a carousel feature to easily view my work. The website is fully responsive and styled with Tailwind, taking modern UX design trends into account."
