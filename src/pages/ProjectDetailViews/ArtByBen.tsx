                about="This store was created independently for the purpose of selling my creations. The App is deployed and available via the globe icon below.

Inspiration for the motion graphics taken from Organsâ€™ creative agency website. I designed the graphics in Figma, before creating the animation in Adobe After Effects. The lettering shape is made up of circles that expand and shrink in a flowing motion, a plastic texture has been applied that accentuates the movement.

The web app is created with Typescript/React, and React testing library for CI/CD integration with Github Actions. Deployed using Netlify, I have integrated Netlify forms to collect customer queries. I have used the Shopify Buy Button to enable sales through my site, and a carousel feature to easily view my work. The website is fully responsive and styled with Tailwind, taking modern UX design trends into account."
